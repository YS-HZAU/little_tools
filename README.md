# some little tools for bioinformatics

### cal-RNA-file.py
Statistical RNA-Seq data alignment results(hisat2/star/magic-blast/tophat2)<br/>
python ~/cal-RNA-file.py input.sam/bam

### overlap.pl
Calculate the distance between two intervals(chr1   start1  end1    chr2    start2  end2)<br/>
perl overlap.pl bedpe.bed

### compare_exon_intron_coverage.py
if we don't know what type of file(DNA or RNA),wo can detect it through comparing exon and intron coverage,if it RNA file,the exon have higher coverage <br/>
python compare_exon_intron_coverage.py

### reptile.136book.py
using urllib and bs4 to get the story from 136book.com<br/>
python reptile.136book.py

### word_cloud_test.py
using jieba and pyecharts to generate the word cloud<br/>
python word_cloud_test.py

### count2FPKM.py
using htseq-count output and gene exon length to calculator the [FPKM and FPKM-UQ](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/Expression_mRNA_Pipeline/)<br/>
python count2FPKM htseq.count exon_gene_length.txt out.txt<br/>
different with TCGA:
    the total reads just use protein_coding gene to calculate the total reads and Q75 reads
