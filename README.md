# some little tools for bioinformatics

### cal-RNA-file.py
Statistical RNA-Seq data alignment results(hisat2/star/magic-blast/tophat2)<br/>
python ~/cal-RNA-file.py input.sam/bam

### overlap.pl
Calculate the distance between two intervals(chr1   start1  end1    chr2    start2  end2)<br/>
perl overlap.pl bedpe.bed

### compare_exon_intron_coverage.py
if we don't know what type of file(DNA or RNA),wo can detect it through comparing exon and intron coverage,if it RNA file,the exon have higher coverage <br/>
python compare_exon_intron_coverage.py
